--- Q.B-1 --- :

insert into ligue 
select l.id, l.name, c.name 
from data_L3.league l, data_L3.country c 
where l.country_id = c.id;


CREATE DATABASE LINK to_b
  CONNECT TO username IDENTIFIED BY password
  USING tns_alias_on_a_pointing_to_b

And then when you connect to A, you could do something like

SELECT aa.name, dd.id
  FROM a aa,
       d@to_b dd
 WHERE aa.some_key = dd.some_key


create public database link
  mylink
connect to
  remote_username
identified by
  mypassword
using 'myserver:1521/MYSID';
